# UAS TASK
Image detection model for counting number of fruits using YOLO,Open-cv and numpy.
This project uses a YOLO (You Only Look Once) model to detect fruits in front and back view images. It aligns both views using homography and counts unique fruits based on their position and color.

Features:
1.Detects fruits using a YOLO model.
<br>
2.Identifies the dominant color of each fruit using refined HSV color ranges.
<br>
3.Aligns front and back view images using feature matching and homography.
<br>
4.Counts unique fruits across both views.
<br>
5.Displays detected fruits and their respective colors.

Requirements:
Ensure you have the following installed:
<br>
Python 3.x
<br>
OpenCV
<br>
NumPy
<br>
Ultralytics YOLOv8
